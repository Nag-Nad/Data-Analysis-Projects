## üìå Project Objectives

This project aims to:

- Analyze public school performance data in Chicago using SQL and Python.
- Explore relationships between school-level metrics (e.g., safety score, college enrollment, student attendance) and community-level hardship indicators.
- Create clear, insightful visualizations to identify key patterns and trends in education and community factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the primary environment for coding, data analysis, and visualization.
- **SQLite**: Used for querying and managing structured data efficiently.
- **Python**: Used for reading CSV files, performing data manipulation, and creating visualizations with libraries such as: _pandas_ for data handling, _matplotlib_ and _seaborn_ for charts and plots, _squarify_ for treemaps

## üìÇ Dataset

1. **ChicagoPublicSchools.csv**: The city of Chicago released a dataset showing all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. 

2. **ChicagoCensusData.csv**: The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal. This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a ‚Äúhardship index,‚Äù for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 ‚Äì 2012. Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.

## üìä Key Analyses Performed

- Filtered and cleaned percentage-based data for numerical comparison.
- Used SQL queries to explore:
  - Top and bottom schools by attendance and safety scores
  - Schools with lowest college enrollment
  - Relationships between hardship index and educational outcomes (college enrollments)
- Visualized results using:
  - Bar charts for schools with average student attendance lower than 70%
  - Treemaps for community-wise enrollment
