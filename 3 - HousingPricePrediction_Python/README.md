## üîç Key Analysis Performed

- **Data Wrangling**  
  - Dropped unused columns and handled missing (`NaN`) values to clean the dataset for analysis.

- **Outlier Detection & Correlation Analysis**  
  - Used **box plots** to identify outliers, especially for comparing house prices with and without waterfront views.  
  - Employed **regression plots** to visualize the relationship between price and square footage.  
  - Calculated correlation coefficients to determine the strength of relationships between various features and house price.

- **Model Development & Evaluation**  
  - Built a **Linear Regression model** using two key features and evaluated its performance using the R¬≤ score.  
  - Expanded the model with multiple relevant features to improve accuracy.  
  - Created a **Ridge Regression model**, and further enhanced it using **Polynomial Features** to capture non-linear relationships.  
  - Compared R¬≤ scores across models to assess performance improvements.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Utilized visual tools like box plots and regression plots to uncover patterns and outliers.  
  - Investigated correlations between features and target variable (price).

- **Statistical Modeling**  
  - Applied linear regression and ridge regression techniques to predict house prices.  
  - Evaluated model performance using R¬≤ score and interpreted results.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Selected meaningful features for modeling and experimented with polynomial transformations to improve model accuracy.

- **Python Programming**  
  - Leveraged libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, and `numpy` for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks.
