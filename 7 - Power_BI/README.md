## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Brew Heaven is a cozy local coffee shop chain known for its warm ambiance and fantastic brews. However, they faced a major challenge: their key business dataâ€”sales, inventory, and customer feedbackâ€”was stored in separate Excel sheets, making it difficult to analyze holistically.

The owner, wanted a unified, interactive dashboard to:
- Track daily sales trends
- Monitor product performance and inventory
- Understand customer satisfaction and feedback

My mission as was to bring this scattered data together into a **clean, insightful Power BI dashboard** that helps the owner make smarter decisions.
