### **Tools & Demonstrated Skills**:

*   **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**: The script demonstrates effective use of **Pandas** for loading data from different file formats (CSV and text), handling missing values, and splitting and renaming columns for easier analysis.
    
*   **Data Merging**: Utilized **Pandas** to merge data from multiple sources, ensuring consistency across datasets and retaining only relevant information for analysis.
    
*   **Data Visualization**: The analysis makes use of **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for creating clear, insightful visualizations, including:
    
    *   **Histograms** for understanding the distribution of data.
        
    *   **Boxplots** and **Violin plots** for visualizing score variability.
        
    *   **PairGrid** for comparing multiple variables at once, providing a comprehensive view of the relationships between them.
        
*   **Correlation Analysis**: Implemented **heatmaps** and other visual methods to explore relationships between different data points, helping to identify any trends or connections within the dataset.
    
*   **Scripting & Automation**: The code leverages modular Python functions to automate the process of data loading, cleaning, merging, and visualization, ensuring repeatability and efficiency for future analysis.

### **Conclusion**:
Through this data analysis process, I successfully loaded and merged data from multiple files with different formats, cleaned and organized the information, and visualized it using various techniques. The score distribution and correlation analysis across different datasets provided me with a clear overview of how the data behaves. By using tools like histograms, boxplots, and violin plots, I was able to identify patterns and trends that help me draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

Ultimately, this process demonstrates the power of combining data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization to gain insights and make data-driven conclusions, ensuring that the analysis is both thorough and interpretable.
