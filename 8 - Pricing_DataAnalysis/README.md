# 🛒 Price Positioning Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing product pricing data to assess competitive positioning in comparison to market competitors.

## 📁 Task Description

Given a CSV file containing the following columns:

- **Wettbewerber** (Competitor)
- **Artikelnummer** (Article Number)
- **Artikelname** (Article Name)
- **Kategorie** (Category)
- **Gebinde** (Packaging Unit)
- **Verpackung** (Packaging)
- **Produktgruppe** (Product Group)
- **Literpreis Wettbewerber** (Competitor Price per Liter)
- **Wettbewerberpreis** (Competitor Price)
- **Unser Preis** (Our Price)

The goal is to analyze pricing data using Python and present the results visually. The analysis aims to answer the following:

### 🔍 Key Questions

1. **Overall Price Positioning**  
   - What are the general price levels of our products?
2. **Price Comparison with Competitors**  
   - How many products are cheaper, equally priced, or more expensive than the competition?
   - What is the price difference per product?
3. **Product Group Competitiveness**  
   - In which product groups are we competitively priced or significantly more expensive on average?
4. **Outliers and Patterns**  
   - Are there any noticeable outliers or systematic pricing patterns?

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes clear and informative visualizations such as:

- Bar charts showing average price deviations by product group
- Distributions of our prices vs. competitor prices
- Price difference categorizations (cheaper, equal, more expensive)

All visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
