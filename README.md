## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for the projects I’ve completed while learning and practicing data analysis using real-world datasets. Each folder contains:

- 📁 A project-specific dataset (or link to the data source)
- 📝 A Jupyter Notebook or Python script with my analysis
- 📈 Visualizations and statistical summaries
- 🧠 Key takeaways and model performance metrics

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

- **Python**: Core programming language used for data handling, modeling, and visualization  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Primary environment for interactive coding  
- **SQL** *(in some projects)*: For structured data querying
