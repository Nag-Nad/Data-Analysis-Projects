This repository serves as a central hub for the projects I’ve completed while learning and practicing data analysis using real-world datasets. Each folder contains:

- 📁 A project-specific dataset (or link to the data source)
- 📝 A Jupyter Notebook or Python script with my analysis
- 📈 Visualizations and statistical summaries
- 🧠 Key takeaways and model performance metrics
